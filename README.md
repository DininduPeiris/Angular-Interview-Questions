* TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding types to the language.

8. Explain the importance of Angular CLI?
* Angular CLI is a command-line interface by which we can create an initial Angular project template. So rather than starting from scratch, we have some boilerplate code. (npm install @angular/cli -> ng new myapp)

9. Explain the importance of the Component and Modules.
* Component is where you write your binding code.
* Module logically groups components.

10. What is a decorator in Angular?
* Decorator defines what kind of Angular class it is. For example, if you decorate "@Component", then it says it's an Angular Component; if you put "@NgNodule", it becomes an Angular Module.

11. What is a template?
* An HTML view of Angular in which we can write directives.
* There are two ways of defining a Template: one is Inline, and the other is a separate HTML file.

12. What is data binding?
* Data binding in Angular defines how the view and component communicate with each other. 

13. Explain the four types of Data bindings in Angular?
* Expression/ Interpolation {{}} - Data flows from the component to the view, and we can mix the same with HTML tags.
* Property binding [] - Data flows from the component to the view.
* Event binding () - when you want to send an event from the view to the component.
* Two-way binding [()] - Data flows from the component to the view and vice versa.
